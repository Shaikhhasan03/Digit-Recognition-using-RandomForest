# Digit-Recognition-using-RandomForest

We can regonize the digits in the picture but suppose if the same picture is given you in form of pixels, then you can't recognize.
The dataset i use is not contain images but it has pixels values.
Through the Machine Learning algorithm i was able to regonize what is the digit.
I use Random Forest algorithm which gives me 96% accuracy.
